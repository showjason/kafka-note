# Kafka Knowledge Base ðŸ“š

A *NOT* comprehensive collection of Apache Kafka knowledge and best practices, born from real-world production experience.

## ðŸš€ Background

This knowledge base was created during my journey of introducing Apache Kafka into our production systems. Through hands-on experience in independently setting up, configuring, and maintaining Kafka clusters, combined with extensive research of official documentation and community resources, I've compiled this practical guide to help others learn and master Kafka.

## ðŸ“– What You'll Find Here

This repository contains in-depth documentation covering essential Kafka concepts and operations
